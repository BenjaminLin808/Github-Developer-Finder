# Design, develop, and test an app from scratch in React Native

This project is inspired by [this Frontend Mentor project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6).

This is the code base for an app that searches for an displays GitHub user information. The completed code can be accessed from https://github.com/Neo-Hao/react-native-github-user-search. This application was adapted and improved based on what ChatGPT generated. The prompts that were used to solicit the rough code base from ChatGPT include:

* build an app that searches for and displays GitHub user information using React Native
* improve the style of this app

This application will render to as follows:
